Lucia Day is still an exceptionally commercial holiday. It took its current form after a competition organized by „Stockholms Dagsblad” in 1927. The winner, known as Lucia, the most beautiful blonde, walked a set route through Stockholm with lights in her hair. The idea for the competition spread through other newspapers, introducing Lucia into the contemporary public sphere. 

The Church seized on the idea and added a Christian element based on the story of one of the saints. Lucia lived in Sicily. She was very spiritual, empathetic, and down-to-earth. She valued her independence and had the courage to defy the social norms of her time. A rejected admirer, in anger, handed her over to her persecutor, contributing to her agonizing death. When Lucia was sentenced to forced prostitution, she gouged out her eyes to disfigure herself. Her beautiful eyes were her unique asset. There are several versions of her death. It is said that she was so stubborn and persistent that she refused to leave the courtroom. They even tried to pour hot oil on her and set her on fire. Nothing worked. The matter ended with a male participant stabbing Lucia in the neck. She died after bleeding to death for several hours.

Another version suggests Lucia was publicly beheaded.

She was 23 years old and murdered on December 13, 304.

In 2016, St. Kronoberg reported that interest in the competition was waning. They failed to gather enough participants.

It was a visible sign of the coming change and the collective liberation of young women who refuse to accept chauvinism in any form.

And at this point, history repeats itself... There were times when the presence of Lussi, an uncompromising troll, was felt, ensuring that preparations for this darkest and coldest time of year were made. It goes without saying that this was an exceptionally important task. And Lussi was apparently a very effective troll.

Every year at Muff, we organize a Lussi Punk in her spirit.
