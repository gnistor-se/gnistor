Malmö Antifascista invites everyone to a series of meetings on “dialogues on fascism, antifascism, and resistance”. In this first meeting, our guests will hold a participatory lecture in which we will try to answer the question of what Swedish anti-fascism really is. We will review the historical development of the movement up to the present day with comparisons to other countries' movements and the differences that have arisen based on historical experience. 

Today's fascist situation, the various groups and organizations, and the fundamentals of the different orientations of anti-fascism from a theoretical and ideological perspective.
