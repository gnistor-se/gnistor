On Wednesday 20th of August (starting 18:30, late arrivals welcome!) we will have an event with lodis! Location and RSVP below.

We will hang out in a park and write postcards to our elected officials in the EU Parliament telling them to vote no on the chat control proposal.

We’ll write as many postcards as we have postage and postcards - so if you want to donate stamps (Utrikes 44kr) or postcards - please do! Join the chat and announce your donation and we’ll handle it from there.
What are we opposing?

The topic at hand is a controversial proposal by the EU parliament, nicknamed Chat Control.

> The “Chat Control” proposal would mandate scanning of all private digital communications, including encrypted messages and photos. This threatens fundamental privacy rights and digital security for all EU citizens.

> EU politicians exempt themselves from this surveillance under “professional secrecy” rules.

> Every photo, every message, every file you send will be automatically scanned—without your consent or suspicion. This is not about catching criminals. It is mass surveillance imposed on all 450 million citizens of the European Union.

The proposal is currently being fast-tracked by the Danish EU presidency for approval October of this year, and officials will be meeting next month after their vacations end.
