Join us for a unique evening of culture, testimony, and solidarity.

Welcome to the Andrey X Speaking Tour. This event brings audiences face-to-face with the realities of life under occupation in Palestine. Through first-hand accounts, the program highlights stories of resilience, resistance, and the human consequences of demolitions and settler violence.

Beyond testimony, the evening features a dynamic cultural program — including live music, spoken word, and standup — creating a space where art, humor, and reflection come together. In the foyer, audiences can explore a solidarity fair showcasing grassroots organizations and local craftsmen, offering insight and connection to cultural and social initiatives.

This is more than an event — it is a gathering of voices, bridging cultural gaps, sparking dialogue, and inspiring action. Each city on the tour will have a unique program, featuring local artists, panels, and special performances alongside Andrey’s testimony.

🎭 Program: Keynote, panel discussion, standup, spoken word, and music. A detailed program will be announced shortly.
