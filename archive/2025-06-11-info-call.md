XR Norway invites all European and global activists to hear more about the biggest action against Norwegian oil ever. The Nordic climate movement is already on board, consisting of 10 organizations and movements, and now we want to mobilize in Europe as well!

Norway is Europe's biggest fossil producer and plans to aggressively expand in the Arctic. We demand a rapid phase out plan to ensure climate justice for all. Join the call to learn about our actions from 18-22.august where we intend to shut down the oil state of Norway!

The call will be from 19:00 - 20:00 Central European Summer Time (GMT+02:00)
