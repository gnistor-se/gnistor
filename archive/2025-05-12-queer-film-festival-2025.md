★ QUEER FILM FESTIVAL ★

Come join the Ecosocialist Collective, Smålands Nation and Cinema Queer for this years Queer film festival on Monday the 12th of May. 

At the festival we will be screening some films focusing on queerness as we try to spread awareness and create a safer space for queerness. Outside of the program, there will be many fun things to do and try, we have a screen-printing workshop, clothing swap, so remember to bring clothing for both. Further India Däck will be there with a table with amazing books and there will be an amazing tattoo artist there ready to mark you from this amazing event!

So bring your friends, partners and strangers to become friends and enjoy a night in the light of queerness!

★ HOLDING BACK THE TIDE ★
Film by Emily Parker, this will be the premiere showing of this film in Sweden.

A quirky, lyrical love letter to oysters in NYC, this engaging documentary plumbs the history of the bivalves, their pollution-fueled decline, and their inspiring revival, finding poetry and charm in an unlikely subject

Through interviews, recited poetry, and quirky interstitials, this engaging documentary charts the unlikely presence of oysters in NYC, the myriad waterways surrounding the city, the scourge of pollution, and triumphant revitalization efforts. Poetic filming of familiar city scenes combines with fascinating archival photos for a watery love letter to the city. Lovingly crafted and scored with flair, the film both embraces humor and nods to the gender-fluid nature of oysters. - Karen McMullen

19:30
★ LANDLINE ★
A short film by Matt Houghton, Landline is a short documentary about the only helpline in the UK for gay farmers. Through a series of recorded telephone conversations and reconstructive visuals, the film uses the helpline as a lens through which to view the experiences of LGBTQ people in the British farming community.

19:50
★ MY BROTHER IS A MERMAID ★
A short film by Alfie Dale. My Brother is a Mermaid is magical realism about the experiences of a non-binary teenager, as seen through the eyes of their 7-year-old brother. Set in a desolate seaside town, the film fuses social realism with fairytale, as it examines how a childs innocence and unconditional love can be a powerful and disruptive force for good.

20:15
★ QUEER GARDENING ★
A film by Ella von der Haide. Queerness was and sometimes still is considered “un-natural.” Queer gardening challenges this “un-naturalness” by creating queer-feminist ecologies.
Our documentary examines what horticultures look like when binaries such as nature/culture, human/more-than-human and body/environment are deconstructed in creative ways.

21:30
