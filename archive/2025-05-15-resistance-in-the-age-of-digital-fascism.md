Resistance in The Age of Digital Fascism – How can we resist fascism in a digital world engineered for control, distraction, and profit?

Comrades, siblings, beautiful army of lovers! Its time for us to learn more about how to protect ourselves from digital fascism!

In an age where the digital platforms we depend on are increasingly controlled by corporate interests and shaped by algorithms that suppress people, how do we organize for justice, equity, and liberation for all?

Join us for an important conversation with tech experts, activists and organizers as we explore the challenges and possibilities of resisting fascism in a digital landscape designed for surveillance, distraction, and profit. Together, we’ll unpack strategies for regaining power, protecting our movements, and reclaiming the internet as a space for collective resistance.

This event will take place online and is free and open to all. The panel discussion will be held in English. 

WHEN: May 15th
TIME: 19:00-20:00 / 7PM-8PM (CEST)
WHERE: Online (link for this event will be shared on the day of the event)
