★ DYKES ON A HIKE ★

Feministkafé Ronja invites you to DYKES ON A HIKE, a separatist event for sapphics, women and trans people only! 

The term is ending soon, and what better way to end it than with a hike on the beach.

MEET UP: 13:30 at Lund C, bus stop H for the bus to Lomma.
If you want to go to Lomma alone, the meeting place is at Lomma bus station at 14:00.

Then the hike begins to Lomma beach! There will be other activities at the beach; kubb, frisbee or, if anyone would like, swimming! 

The hike ends at 17:00 o'clock, hope to see you there!
